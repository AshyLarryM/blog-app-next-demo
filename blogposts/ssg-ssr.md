We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing
- Blog Posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask youself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?"  If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation/
